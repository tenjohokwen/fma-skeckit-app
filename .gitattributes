# Multi-Client Branching Strategy - Merge Strategies
# These rules ensure client-specific files are preserved during merges from main

# Client-specific config - always keep client version during merges
config/clients/*.json merge=ours

# Client-specific branding - never merge from core
branding/** merge=ours

# Desktop build-time config - always keep local version
desktop/client-config.json merge=ours
desktop/branding/** merge=ours

# Application code - prefer core version in conflicts
src/** merge=theirs
