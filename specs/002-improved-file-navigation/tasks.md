- [ ] T079 [US11] Implement GAS file.rename endpoint in `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/gas/handlers/FileHandler.gs` with rename method that validates fileId exists, validates newName is non-empty and within 255 chars, gets oldName before renaming, calls file.setName(newName), returns standardized response with fileId, oldName, newName, modifiedAt timestamp
- [ ] T080 [US11] Update GAS Router at `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/gas/utils/Router.gs` to add route mapping for action "file.rename" to FileHandler.rename
- [ ] T081 [US11] Add renameFile action to Files Pinia store at `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/src/stores/files.js`: renameFile function that calls API file.rename endpoint with fileId and newName, updates file name in currentFolderContents.files array by finding file with matching fileId, shows success notification, handles validation errors (empty name, invalid name)
- [ ] T082 [US11] Create rename dialog in FileActions component at `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/src/components/files/FileActions.vue`: add rename QBtn with edit icon; on click, show QDialog with QCard; QInput pre-filled with current fileName; QCardActions with Cancel and Rename buttons; validate newName non-empty and max 255 chars; on Rename confirm, emit renameFile event with fileId and newName; max 250 lines (component may need refactoring if over limit)
- [ ] T083 [US11] Add rename button to FolderBrowser component: FileActions component already integrated (from US8, US9); listen to renameFile event from FileActions; call Files store renameFile action with fileId and newName; on success, file name automatically updated in list via store reactivity
- [ ] T084 [US11] Wire up rename with list refresh: in Files store renameFile action, after successful API call, find file in currentFolderContents.files array by fileId; update file.name property to newName; Vue reactivity will automatically update FolderBrowser component display; show success message with old and new names

**Checkpoint**: User Story 11 complete - Users can rename files with immediate feedback

## Phase 14: Polish & Integration

**Purpose**: Cross-cutting improvements affecting multiple user stories

- [ ] T085 [P] [POLISH] Add loading states to all components: ClientSearchForm, ClientSearchResults, ClientForm, ClientDetails, CaseList, CaseForm, FileUpload, FolderBrowser, BreadcrumbNav; use QSpinner, QSkeleton, or QInnerLoading as appropriate for each component type
- [ ] T086 [P] [POLISH] Complete English i18n translations at `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/src/i18n/en-US/index.js`: add all msgKey values used in GAS endpoints (client.search.success, client.create.success, case.create.success, file.upload.success, file.delete.success, file.rename.success, folder.delete.success, validation errors, etc.)
- [ ] T087 [P] [POLISH] Complete French i18n translations at `/Users/mokwen/dev/gitrepos/bluegithub/fma-skeckit-app/src/i18n/fr-FR/index.js`: translate all English msgKey values to French equivalents maintaining same key structure
- [ ] T088 [P] [POLISH] Add error handling to all API calls: wrap api.js calls in try-catch blocks; use useNotification composable to show error messages; handle specific error codes (401 unauthorized, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 500 server error); display user-friendly messages from i18n
- [ ] T089 [POLISH] Mobile responsiveness testing: test all pages and components on 375px width viewport (iPhone SE); verify SearchPage, ClientManagementPage, FileManagementPage layouts work on mobile; check BreadcrumbNav truncation; verify QDialog modals fit on mobile screens; adjust Quasar grid classes as needed (col-12, col-md-6, etc.)
- [ ] T090 [P] [POLISH] Edge case handling for client creation: handle special characters in names (spaces, accents, hyphens) by sanitizing in GAS ClientHandler.create; prevent folder name conflicts by appending UUID if folder exists; handle Drive API permission errors with user-friendly messages
- [ ] T091 [P] [POLISH] Edge case handling for file uploads: handle duplicate filenames (Drive auto-renames, inform user); handle network interruptions (show retry option); handle files >50MB (show error before upload attempt); validate MIME types match file extensions
- [ ] T092 [P] [POLISH] Performance optimization for search: implement debouncing (300ms) on ClientSearchForm input fields; cache Fuse.js index in Client store to avoid re-indexing on every search; limit search results to 100 clients; show "X of Y results" indicator
- [ ] T093 [P] [POLISH] Performance optimization for folder browsing: cache folder contents in Files store for recently visited folders (Map with folder ID keys); implement loading skeletons (QSkeleton) while fetching folder contents; lazy load file thumbnails if implemented
- [ ] T094 [POLISH] Accessibility improvements: add aria-labels to all icon buttons (download, delete, rename); ensure WCAG AA contrast ratios for all text (verify with Quasar color classes); add keyboard navigation support for breadcrumbs (tab + enter); ensure form validation errors are announced to screen readers
- [ ] T095 [POLISH] Security hardening: verify all GAS endpoints validate token via SecurityInterceptor; check all user inputs are sanitized before Drive/Sheets operations; validate file MIME types server-side in FileHandler.upload; ensure folder deletion checks user permissions; add rate limiting for file uploads if needed

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-13)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) after Phase 2
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí US11)
- **Polish (Phase 14)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but independently testable
- **US3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses Client store from US1/US2 but independently testable
- **US4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US3 but independently testable
- **US5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires Files store but independently testable
- **US6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses Navigation store independently
- **US7 (P7)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US6 but independently testable
- **US8 (P8)**: Depends on US7 (needs FolderBrowser component) - Adds download to file display
- **US9 (P9)**: Depends on US7/US8 (needs FolderBrowser and FileActions) - Adds delete to file display
- **US10 (P10)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent folder deletion
- **US11 (P11)**: Depends on US7/US8/US9 (needs FileActions component) - Adds rename to file display

### Within Each User Story

- GAS handlers before router updates
- Store actions before components that use them
- Composables before components that use them
- Parent components before child component integration
- Core implementation before integration with other stories

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T001, T002, T003)
- **Phase 2**: Tasks T004-T012 marked [P] can run in parallel
- **User Stories**: US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6, US10 can start in parallel after Phase 2 (independent implementations)
- **Within US1**: T013, T014, T017, T018 marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Within US2**: T024 can run in parallel with T021-T023
- **Within US3**: T030, T031 marked [P] can run in parallel after T027-T029 complete
- **Within US4**: T036 can run in parallel with T034-T035
- **Within US5**: T041, T042 marked [P] can run in parallel after T039-T040 complete
- **Within US6**: T046, T047 marked [P] can run in parallel
- **Phase 14**: Tasks T085-T095 marked [P] can run in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1-US11)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group of tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Component size limit is 250 lines - if FileActions or FileManagementPage exceed this during US9-US11, refactor by extracting dialogs to separate components
- All file paths are absolute paths from repository root
- Tests are NOT included as they were not requested in the specification
- Constitution compliance verified: Vue 3 Composition API, plain JavaScript, Quasar components, no TypeScript, functional splitting, performance optimization
