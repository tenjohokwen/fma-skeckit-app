# Feature Specification: Improved File Navigation UX

**Feature Branch**: `002-improved-file-navigation`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want adjustments to the UX. The user should actually be less involved with the structure of the underlying file system. I want the user to be able to navigate folders by clicking. As the user navigates he should have the possibility to download, delete or rename a file in the current directory or upload it."

**Note**: All features must comply with the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, including Vue 3 Composition API requirements, component isolation testing standards, design system specifications, and performance requirements.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Client Search and Discovery (Priority: P1)

A user needs to find an existing client or determine that a client doesn't exist in the system. They enter the client's first name, last name, and national ID to search. The system shows matching results even if there are minor typos. If a client is found, they see all client details and can create a new case. If no client is found, they can create a new client record.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary entry point for all case management activities. Without the ability to search and find clients, users cannot proceed with any other workflows. This represents the foundation of the entire system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing searches with valid/invalid client data and verifying search results display correctly. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to locate existing clients without remembering exact folder structures or IDs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on the client search page, **When** they enter "John" as first name, "Doe" as last name, and "12345" as National ID and click search, **Then** the system displays matching client(s) with their First Name, Last Name, Telephone, National ID, and Email
2. **Given** the user searches for a client with a minor typo (e.g., "Jon" instead of "John"), **When** the fuzzy search runs, **Then** the system still returns the correct client "John Doe"
3. **Given** search results show an existing client, **When** the results are displayed, **Then** a "Create New Case" button is visible
4. **Given** no clients match the search criteria, **When** search results are displayed, **Then** a "Create New Client" option is shown
5. **Given** the user is on mobile device, **When** they access the search page, **Then** all input fields and buttons are appropriately sized and accessible

---

### User Story 2 - Client Creation (Priority: P2)

A user needs to add a new client to the system. They fill out a form with the client's personal information including required fields (first name, last name, national ID) and optional fields (telephone, email). The system validates that the national ID is unique, creates a folder in Google Drive with a standardized naming format, and shows the new client's details.

**Why this priority**: Essential for onboarding new clients, but depends on the search functionality (P1) to first verify the client doesn't already exist. This is the second step in the natural user workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by filling out the client creation form with valid/invalid data and verifying folder creation in Google Drive. Delivers value by allowing users to onboard new clients into the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user clicks "Create New Client", **When** they fill in First Name "Jane", Last Name "Smith", National ID "67890", Telephone "555-1234", and Email "jane@example.com" and submit, **Then** a new client record is created and a folder "Jane_Smith_67890" is created in the root "cases" folder
2. **Given** the user attempts to create a client, **When** they enter a National ID that already exists in the system, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the National ID must be unique
3. **Given** the user submits the client creation form, **When** the client is successfully created, **Then** a success message is displayed and the form is reset
4. **Given** a new client is created, **When** the success message appears, **Then** the user is returned to the client search/view showing the new client's information
5. **Given** the interface language is set to French, **When** the user views the client creation form, **Then** all labels and messages are displayed in French

---

### User Story 3 - View Client Details and Cases (Priority: P3)

A user wants to see all information about a specific client and their associated cases. They view the client's personal information in a read-only format and see a list of all case folders for that client. Each case shows its Case ID and the number of files it contains. The user can click on any case to navigate into it.

**Why this priority**: Builds on client search (P1) and creation (P2) to provide a comprehensive view of client data. This is important for case management but requires the foundational client data to exist first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a client with existing cases and verifying all client details and case information display correctly. Delivers value by providing users with a quick overview of all client-related work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client "John Doe" is selected, **When** the client details page loads, **Then** the system displays First Name, Last Name, Telephone, National ID, and Email in read-only format
2. **Given** a client has three case folders (Tax_2024, Immigration_2024, Business_2025), **When** the client details page loads, **Then** all three cases are listed with their Case IDs
3. **Given** a case folder contains 5 files, **When** the case is displayed in the list, **Then** the system shows "5 files" for that case
4. **Given** the user views the list of cases for a client, **When** they click on a case, **Then** the system navigates into that case folder and displays its contents

---

### User Story 4 - Case Creation (Priority: P4)

A user needs to create a new case for an existing client. They enter a unique Case ID, and the system validates that this ID doesn't already exist within the client's folder. The system creates a new subfolder within the client's folder and automatically navigates the user into the new case folder.

**Why this priority**: Necessary for organizing client work into specific cases, but requires client data (P2/P3) to exist first. This is a supporting feature that enables the file management workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a new case for an existing client and verifying the folder structure and auto-navigation. Delivers value by organizing client work into manageable cases.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client "John_Doe_12345" is selected, **When** the user enters Case ID "Tax_2024" and creates a new case, **Then** a folder "cases/John_Doe_12345/Tax_2024" is created
2. **Given** a client already has a case with ID "Tax_2024", **When** the user tries to create another case with the same ID, **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the Case ID must be unique within the client folder
3. **Given** a new case is successfully created, **When** the success message appears, **Then** the system automatically navigates into the new case folder
4. **Given** the user creates a case, **When** the case creation completes, **Then** a success message is displayed

---

### User Story 5 - File Upload to Case (Priority: P5)

A user wants to upload files to a specific case. They select multiple files from their device, optionally provide display names for the files, and see upload progress for each file. After upload completes, the file list refreshes automatically, and the user sees success or failure messages for each file.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality for document management, but depends on case structure (P4) being in place. This is where the actual work products are stored.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading single and multiple files to a case folder and verifying progress indicators and success messages. Delivers value by allowing users to store case-related documents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing a case folder, **When** they select 3 PDF files and click upload, **Then** all 3 files are uploaded to the case folder
2. **Given** the user is uploading a file named "document.pdf", **When** they provide a display name "Client Contract 2024", **Then** the file is uploaded with the custom display name
3. **Given** files are being uploaded, **When** the upload is in progress, **Then** the user sees a progress indicator for each file showing upload percentage
4. **Given** files have finished uploading, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the file list automatically refreshes to show the new files
5. **Given** one file uploads successfully and another fails, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the user sees a success message for the successful file and an error message for the failed file

---

### User Story 6 - Breadcrumb Navigation (Priority: P6)

A user navigating through the folder hierarchy wants to always know where they are and easily jump back to any parent level. They see a breadcrumb trail showing the full path (e.g., "Cases > John_Doe_12345 > Tax_2024"), with all parts except the current location being clickable links. This works seamlessly on mobile devices.

**Why this priority**: Important for user orientation but not blocking for core workflows. Enhances usability once the basic navigation (P7) is in place.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating deep into folder structures and clicking on different breadcrumb levels. Delivers value by preventing users from getting lost in the folder hierarchy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing the case folder "Cases > John_Doe_12345 > Tax_2024", **When** the page loads, **Then** a breadcrumb trail displays "Cases > John_Doe_12345 > Tax_2024"
2. **Given** the breadcrumb shows "Cases > John_Doe_12345 > Tax_2024", **When** the user clicks on "John_Doe_12345", **Then** the system navigates to the client folder showing all cases
3. **Given** the user is at "Cases > John_Doe_12345 > Tax_2024", **When** viewing the breadcrumb, **Then** "Tax_2024" (current location) is not clickable while "Cases" and "John_Doe_12345" are clickable
4. **Given** the user is on a mobile device, **When** viewing the breadcrumb, **Then** the breadcrumb is responsive and accessible without horizontal scrolling

---

### User Story 7 - Browse and View Folder Contents (Priority: P7)

A user wants to see what's inside a folder by clicking on it. They see a list of both subfolders and files in the current location. Each item shows its name, an icon indicating the type (folder or file type), and the last modified date. Folders appear first, and all items are sorted alphabetically. Folders show how many items they contain.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental navigation mechanism. While important, it works in conjunction with breadcrumbs (P6) and file operations (P8-P10) to create a complete navigation experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking into various folders and verifying the display of contents. Delivers value by allowing users to explore the folder structure visually.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user clicks on a folder, **When** the folder opens, **Then** the system displays both subfolders and files contained within
2. **Given** a folder contains 2 subfolders and 5 files, **When** the contents are displayed, **Then** the 2 subfolders appear first, followed by the 5 files
3. **Given** a folder contains items with names starting with "B", "A", and "C", **When** the folder contents are displayed, **Then** items are sorted alphabetically: A, B, C
4. **Given** a file in the folder is a PDF, **When** the file is displayed, **Then** a PDF icon appears next to the file name
5. **Given** a folder item was last modified on "2024-10-01 14:30", **When** the item is displayed, **Then** the last modified date "2024-10-01 14:30" is shown
6. **Given** a subfolder contains 8 items, **When** the folder is displayed in the list, **Then** the system shows "8 items" next to the folder name

---

### User Story 8 - Download Files (Priority: P8)

A user wants to download a file from a case folder to their local device. They click a download button next to the file, and the file downloads with its display name preserved.

**Why this priority**: Essential for retrieving documents but less critical than uploading (P5). Users need to get files into the system before they need to download them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking download buttons on various file types and verifying downloads complete with correct filenames. Delivers value by allowing users to retrieve documents for review or sharing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing a file named "Contract_2024.pdf", **When** they click the download button, **Then** the file downloads to their device as "Contract_2024.pdf"
2. **Given** the user is viewing a file with display name "Client Agreement", **When** they click download, **Then** the file downloads with the display name "Client Agreement"

---

### User Story 9 - Delete Files (Priority: P9)

A user needs to remove a file that's no longer needed. They click a delete button next to the file, confirm the deletion in a dialog, and the file is permanently removed from Google Drive. The file list updates immediately and shows a success message.

**Why this priority**: Important for data management but less urgent than core creation/upload workflows. Deletion is a less frequent operation than upload/download.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deleting files and verifying confirmation dialogs and list updates. Delivers value by allowing users to maintain clean, organized folders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user clicks the delete button for a file, **When** the action is triggered, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears asking to confirm deletion
2. **Given** the user confirms deletion in the dialog, **When** they click confirm, **Then** the file is permanently deleted from Google Drive
3. **Given** a file is successfully deleted, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** the file list immediately updates to remove the deleted file
4. **Given** a file is deleted, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** a success message is displayed

---

### User Story 10 - Delete Folders (Priority: P10)

A user needs to remove an entire folder and all its contents. They access a "Delete Folder" option while viewing the folder, see a prominent warning about the irreversible action, type "DELETE" to confirm they understand, and the folder is removed. The system navigates back to the parent folder and shows a success message.

**Why this priority**: This is the least frequent and most dangerous operation, so it has the lowest priority. Users need all other folder operations working before they need folder deletion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deleting folders with various contents and verifying warnings and navigation. Delivers value by allowing users to remove obsolete cases or clients, but must be used carefully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is viewing a folder, **When** they access the "Delete Folder" option, **Then** a warning dialog appears with prominent text explaining the action is irreversible
2. **Given** the deletion warning is displayed, **When** the user attempts to confirm, **Then** they must type the word "DELETE" exactly to proceed
3. **Given** the user types "DELETE" and confirms, **When** the deletion executes, **Then** the folder and all its contents are permanently removed from Google Drive
4. **Given** a folder is successfully deleted, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** the system navigates to the parent folder
5. **Given** a folder deletion completes, **When** the user is navigated to the parent folder, **Then** a success message is displayed

---

### User Story 11 - File Renaming (Priority: P11)

A user wants to change the name of a file without re-uploading it. They click a rename option next to the file, enter a new name, and the file is renamed in Google Drive. The file list updates to show the new name.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature for file organization but not essential for core workflows. Users can work around this by deleting and re-uploading with the correct name.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by renaming files and verifying the changes persist in Google Drive. Delivers value by allowing users to correct filenames or update display names without re-uploading.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file is named "document.pdf", **When** the user clicks rename and enters "Final_Contract.pdf", **Then** the file is renamed to "Final_Contract.pdf" in Google Drive
2. **Given** a file is renamed, **When** the rename completes, **Then** the file list immediately updates to show the new filename
3. **Given** a file is renamed successfully, **When** the operation completes, **Then** a success message is displayed
