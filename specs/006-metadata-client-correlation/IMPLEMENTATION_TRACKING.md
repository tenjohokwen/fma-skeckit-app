## Daily Progress

### Day 1: 2025-10-18 (Phase 0 - Pre-Implementation)
- [x] Created backup script (backupMetadataSheet.gs)
- [x] Created implementation tracking document
- [ ] Run backup on production metadata sheet
- [ ] Create test environment
- [ ] Verify backup successful

**Notes**:
- Backup script includes timestamp and protection
- Ready to execute backup before making any schema changes

---

### Day 2: TBD (Phase 1 - Backend Sheet Structure - Part 1)
- [ ] Manually insert Column C in metadata sheet
- [ ] Update METADATA_COLUMNS constants in SheetsService.gs
- [ ] Add isValidUUID() helper function
- [ ] Add getClientById() helper function
- [ ] Test helper functions

**Notes**:

---

### Day 3: TBD (Phase 1 - Backend Sheet Structure - Part 2)
- [ ] Update createCase() method
- [ ] Update getCaseById() method
- [ ] Update searchCasesByName() method
- [ ] Update updateCase() method
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations

**Notes**:

---

### Day 4: TBD (Phase 2 - Backend Handlers)
- [ ] Update createCaseMetadata() handler
- [ ] Update updateCaseMetadata() handler
- [ ] Add _isValidUUID() to MetadataHandler
- [ ] Add i18n messages (English)
- [ ] Add i18n messages (French)
- [ ] Test handlers

**Notes**:

---

### Day 5: TBD (Phase 3 - Frontend Integration)
- [ ] Update case creation flow (ClientDetailsPage.vue)
- [ ] Verify case edit page hides clientId
- [ ] Verify search results hide clientId
- [ ] Test frontend changes
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

**Notes**:

---

### Day 6: TBD (Phase 4 - Data Migration)
- [ ] Create migration script (populateClientIds.gs)
- [ ] Test migration on copy of data
- [ ] Run migration on production
- [ ] Manual review of results
- [ ] Fix orphaned cases

**Notes**:

---

### Day 7: TBD (Phase 5 - Testing - Part 1)
- [ ] Write backend unit tests
- [ ] Run unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Run integration tests

**Notes**:

---

### Day 8: TBD (Phase 5 - Testing - Part 2)
- [ ] Manual UI testing
- [ ] Data validation testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Fix any issues found

**Notes**:

---

### Day 9: TBD (Phase 6 - Deployment)
- [ ] Deploy backend code (clasp push)
- [ ] Deploy frontend code (build + deploy)
- [ ] Smoke testing
- [ ] Monitor for issues
- [ ] Final validation

**Notes**:

## Issues Encountered

### Issue #1: [Example]
**Date**:
**Description**:
**Impact**:
**Resolution**:
**Status**:

---

## Rollback Triggers

Monitor for these conditions that require rollback:
- [ ] Case creation failure rate > 10%
- [ ] Data corruption detected
- [ ] Critical user-blocking bug
- [ ] Performance degradation > 50%
- [ ] More than 5% orphaned cases after migration

---

## Success Metrics

### Migration Metrics (Target)
- [ ] Migration success rate: > 95%
- [ ] Data integrity: 100% (all cases have valid clientId)
- [ ] Orphaned cases: < 5%
- [ ] Manual corrections required: < 10 cases

### Performance Metrics (Target)
- [ ] Case creation time: < 2 seconds (unchanged)
- [ ] Case search time: < 1 second (unchanged)
- [ ] Chart generation: < 3 seconds (improved)

### Code Quality Metrics (Target)
- [ ] Test coverage: > 90%
- [ ] Lint errors: 0
- [ ] Build warnings: 0

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All phases complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled

### Deployment
- [ ] Backend deployed
- [ ] Frontend deployed
- [ ] Smoke tests passed
- [ ] No critical errors

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] No spike in errors
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Final validation passed

---

## Notes and Observations

### General Notes
- Implementation follows the detailed plan in plan.md
- Each phase has specific success criteria
- Testing is comprehensive across all layers

### Technical Decisions
- clientId stored as plain text (UUID format) in Column C
- Validation happens at both handler and service layers
- Migration script handles duplicate names by logging for manual review
- Frontend never displays or allows editing of clientId

### Risks Mitigated
- Backup created before any schema changes
- Migration tested on copy before production
- Rollback plan prepared
- Incremental deployment with smoke testing
