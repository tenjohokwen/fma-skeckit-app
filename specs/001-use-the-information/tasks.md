# Tasks: File Management Application with User Authentication

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-use-the-information/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks must adhere to the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This includes:
- Using Vue 3 `<script setup>` and Composition API exclusively
- Plain JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Functional component splitting with single responsibility
- Component size limits (‚â§250 lines)
- Test file per component
- Design system adherence (colors, typography, layout)
- Performance requirements (lazy loading, efficient reactivity, cleanup)
- Accessibility and responsive design requirements

**Tests**: Tests are included per constitution requirements. Each component must have its own test file.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: `src/` at repository root
- **Backend**: `gas/` at repository root (per constitution)
- **Tests**: `tests/` at repository root
- All file paths are relative to repository root

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order
  - US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P3) ‚Üí US6 (P3) ‚Üí US7 (P4)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1/US2 for login
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1/US2 for login, US3 for search
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1/US2 for login
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1/US2 for login, US5 for client folders
- **User Story 7 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1/US2 for login, US6 for files to navigate

### Within Each User Story

- Backend handlers before frontend services
- Services before components
- Components before pages
- Pages before tests (or tests first if TDD)
- Tests marked [P] can run in parallel (different components)

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1 and US2 can be implemented in parallel (both P1)
  - US3 and US4 can be implemented in parallel after auth is working (both P2)
  - US5, US6, US7 can be implemented in parallel after auth is working (P3-P4)
- All tests marked [P] within a user story can run in parallel
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

T049 [P]: SignUpForm component
T050: SignUpPage (depends on T049)
T051: EmailVerificationPage

# Then i18n
T052: Add i18n keys

# Then tests (all parallel)
T053 [P]: Test SignUpForm
T054 [P]: Test SignUpPage
T055 [P]: Test EmailVerificationPage
T056 [P]: Test useAuth composable

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Registration & Verification)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Login & Password Recovery)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full authentication flow independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready (minimal viable authentication system)

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Infrastructure ready
2. **Auth MVP**: Add US1 + US2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. **Search & View**: Add US3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. **Admin Edit**: Add US4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. **File Management**: Add US5 + US6 + US7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. **Polish**: Add Phase 10 polish tasks ‚Üí Final testing ‚Üí Production release

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T041-T056)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T057-T078)
   - **Developer C**: Foundation tests (T033-T040)
3. After US1+US2 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 3 (T079-T093)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (T094-T110)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 5 (T111-T123)
4. Continue parallel development of US6 and US7
5. All developers work on Polish phase together

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- [Story] label (US1-US7) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Constitution requires tests for all components - tests are mandatory, not optional
- All components must be under 250 lines (constitution requirement)
- All datetime operations must use Africa/Douala timezone
- All text must use i18n keys for English/French support
- All admin operations require role check (ROLE_ADMIN)
- Version number provides optimistic locking for concurrent edits
- File uploads have 10MB size limit (enforced frontend and backend)
- Commit after each task or logical group of related tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
