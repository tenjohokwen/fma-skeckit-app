# Specification Quality Checklist: Simplified UI - Remove File and Client Management Pages

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-21

### Content Quality
✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses entirely on removing UI pages and navigation entries without mentioning Vue, router configuration, or component structure. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Scope) are completed with appropriate detail.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **Pass** - All 9 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous:
- FR-001 through FR-009 specify exactly what must be removed and what must be preserved
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "Navigation menu contains exactly 8 pages or fewer", "Zero navigation errors or broken links remain")
- All success criteria avoid implementation details and focus on user-observable outcomes
- Edge cases identified for bookmarks, hard-coded navigation, deep links, shared components, and test files
- Scope clearly defines 7 items in scope and 8 items out of scope
- 6 assumptions documented (A-001 through A-006)
- 4 dependencies documented (D-001 through D-004)

### Feature Readiness
✅ **Pass** - The specification is ready for planning:
- Three prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios:
  - US1 (P1): Remove File Management Navigation - 4 acceptance scenarios
  - US2 (P2): Remove Client Management Navigation - 4 acceptance scenarios
  - US3 (P3): Clean Up Route Definitions - 3 acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation leakage (no mention of Vue Router, route files, component imports, etc.)
- Feature can be independently tested and deployed
- Migration notes provide clear guidance on what to keep vs. remove

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification successfully defines a focused UI simplification feature for removing unnecessary navigation pages while preserving core functionality. All requirements are clear and testable, with no ambiguities requiring clarification. The feature can proceed directly to `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 > P2 > P3)
- Comprehensive migration notes listing all pages to keep/remove
- Well-defined edge cases for common scenarios (bookmarks, deep links, shared components)
- Explicit preservation requirements to prevent breaking retained functionality
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user experience

### Recommendations
None - specification is complete and ready for implementation planning.
