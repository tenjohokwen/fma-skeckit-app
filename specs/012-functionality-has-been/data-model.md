# Data Model: Update User Guide Documentation

**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-21

## Overview

This feature does NOT involve any data models, entities, or data structures. It is a pure documentation update that modifies a single markdown file to reflect recent application changes.

## Entities

**No entities** - This feature updates documentation only, not application code or data.

## Existing Entities (Unchanged)

All application entities remain completely unchanged by this feature:

- **Client**: No changes to data structure, storage, or operations
- **Case**: No changes to data structure, storage, or operations
- **File**: No changes to data structure, storage, or operations
- **User**: No changes to data structure, storage, or operations
- **Dashboard Analytics**: No changes to data structure, storage, or operations

## Data Flow

**No data flow changes** - This feature only updates documentation. No application data flows, API calls, or business logic are affected.

The documentation update involves:
- Reading: Current docs/user-guide.md content
- Editing: Removing obsolete sections, adding analytics documentation, updating navigation
- Writing: Updated docs/user-guide.md content

## Storage

**No storage changes** - Documentation is stored as a plain text markdown file in the repository at `/docs/user-guide.md`. No databases, APIs, or external storage systems are involved.

File storage details:
- **Location**: `/docs/user-guide.md` (repository root)
- **Format**: Markdown (.md) plain text file
- **Version Control**: Git tracks changes
- **Size**: ~718 lines (current) → ~570-620 lines (after update)

## Migration

**No data migration required** - This is a documentation-only change with zero impact on application data, stored entities, or user information.

## Documentation Metadata

The documentation file itself contains metadata that will be updated:

- **Version**: 1.0 → 1.1 (minor version bump)
- **Last Updated**: October 14, 2025 → October 21, 2025
- **Line Count**: ~718 lines → ~570-620 lines (after cleanup)

This metadata is informational only and does not affect any application functionality.

## Summary

This feature has no data model implications whatsoever. It is a pure content editing task on a single documentation file with no impact on application code, data structures, storage systems, or business logic.
