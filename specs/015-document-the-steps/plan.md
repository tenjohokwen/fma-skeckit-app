# Implementation Plan: Application Icon & Splash Screen Replacement Guide

**Branch**: `015-document-the-steps` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/015-document-the-steps/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature creates comprehensive developer documentation for replacing application icons and splash screens in the desktop application. The documentation will guide developers through replacing the default blue placeholder icon with client-specific branding, covering file locations, format requirements, build processes, and git workflows for both main and client branches.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (documentation)
**Primary Dependencies**: N/A (static documentation)
**Storage**: Documentation files in repository (likely `docs/` or README section)
**Testing**: Manual validation by following documented steps
**Target Platform**: Developer documentation (human-readable)
**Project Type**: Documentation (not applicable to constitution source structure)
**Performance Goals**: Developers complete icon replacement in under 10 minutes
**Constraints**: Documentation must be accessible without special tools, work offline
**Scale/Scope**: Single documentation file covering ~10 functional requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitution Applicability Analysis

### Constitution Compliance Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASS with N/A**

This documentation feature does not involve writing Vue components, JavaScript code, or Google Apps Script. The constitution principles apply to implementation code, not documentation.

**Applicable Requirements**:
- Documentation MUST be clear and concise (analogous to "Clean & Readable Code")
- Documentation MUST be tested by actual developers following the steps (analogous to "Realistic Test Scenarios")
- Documentation MUST be accurate and complete (from Success Criteria)

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```
specs/015-document-the-steps/
├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)
├── spec.md              # Feature specification (already created)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output - research on documentation best practices
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output - documentation structure and sections
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output - quick reference for icon replacement
├── checklists/
│   └── requirements.md  # Specification quality checklist (already created)
└── contracts/           # N/A for documentation feature
```

### Source Code (repository root)

This is a documentation feature. The output will be documentation files, not source code:

```
docs/                           # Proposed location for documentation
├── ICON-REPLACEMENT.md         # Main documentation file (to be created)
└── assets/                     # Optional: screenshots/diagrams
    └── icon-replacement/       # Screenshots showing icon locations, build output, etc.

OR (alternative location)

desktop/
└── README-ICONS.md            # Documentation alongside desktop/ folder

OR (alternative - update existing README)

README.md                       # Add "Replacing Application Icons" section
```

**Structure Decision**: The documentation will be created as a standalone file in the `docs/` directory (`docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md`) to keep it organized and discoverable. This follows common open-source documentation patterns where detailed guides are in `docs/` and the main README links to them.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitution violations - documentation feature does not require code complexity tracking.*

N/A - All constitution checks marked as N/A or passed.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks

Since this is a documentation feature with no technical unknowns, research focuses on documentation best practices and completeness:

1. **Icon File Format Research**
   - Verify current desktop/icons/ structure
   - Confirm electron-builder icon requirements
   - Document platform-specific format conversions (.icns, .ico)

2. **Git Workflow Research**
   - Document current branching strategy (main → client/{name})
   - Identify potential merge conflict scenarios
   - Define best practices for syncing icon changes across branches

3. **Documentation Structure Research**
   - Review markdown documentation best practices (headings, code blocks, examples)
   - Identify optimal documentation location (docs/ vs README vs desktop/README)
   - Research screenshot/diagram needs for clarity

4. **Build Process Research**
   - Document exact build commands for each platform
   - Identify build cache clearing commands
   - Document verification steps (how to confirm icon was applied)

5. **Icon Design Best Practices**
   - Research recommended icon sizes and formats
   - Document transparency handling across platforms
   - Identify common icon design pitfalls (details that don't scale)

### Research Output

All findings will be consolidated in `research.md` with:
- Decision: What documentation location/format was chosen
- Rationale: Why this choice (discoverability, maintainability, standard practices)
- Alternatives considered: Other documentation approaches evaluated

---

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Documentation Model (data-model.md equivalent)

Instead of data entities, we'll define documentation sections and their structure:

**Documentation Sections** (required):
1. **Overview**: What this guide covers, who it's for
2. **Prerequisites**: Required tools, permissions, knowledge
3. **Icon Requirements**: Format, dimensions, design recommendations
4. **File Locations**: Exact paths for desktop/icons/ and branding/{client}/
5. **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
   - For main branch
   - For client branches
   - Verification steps
6. **Build Commands**: Platform-specific build commands
7. **Git Workflow**: Merging icon changes from main to client branches
8. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors and solutions
9. **Examples**: Before/after screenshots, sample commands

### Quickstart Guide

A one-page quick reference covering:
- Icon requirements (1024x1024 PNG)
- File paths to update
- Build and verify commands
- One-line git workflow

### Contracts

For a documentation feature, "contracts" means:
- **Documentation completeness checklist**: Verify all 10 functional requirements are addressed
- **Validation checklist**: Steps to verify documentation is accurate
- **Acceptance test**: A developer following the guide successfully replaces an icon

---

## Next Steps

After this plan is approved:
1. **Phase 0**: Generate `research.md` with findings on documentation structure, icon requirements, git workflows
2. **Phase 1**: Create `data-model.md` (documentation section structure) and `quickstart.md` (one-page reference)
3. **Phase 2** (via `/speckit.tasks`): Generate tasks for writing the actual documentation file

**Command to continue**: `/speckit.tasks`
