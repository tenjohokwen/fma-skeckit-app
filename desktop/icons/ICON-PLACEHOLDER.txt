PLACEHOLDER ICON CREATED

âœ… A temporary placeholder icon (icon.png) has been created for development/testing purposes.

The current icon is a simple solid blue square (1024x1024 PNG).

**IMPORTANT**: Replace this with your actual branded icon before production distribution!

To replace with your real icon:

1. Create or obtain a 1024x1024 PNG image with your FMA Skeckit App logo
2. Replace the existing: desktop/icons/icon.png
3. Ensure it has a transparent background for best results
4. Use professional design software (Figma, Photoshop, etc.) or an icon generator

Suggested tools:
- Design in Figma and export as 1024x1024 PNG
- Use an online icon generator (e.g., https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- Professional icon design services

The electron-builder will automatically convert your icon.png to all required formats:
- Windows .ico (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
- macOS .icns (16x16 to 512x512, plus @2x retina versions)
- Linux .png (multiple sizes)
