# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Client Branching Strategy and CI/CD

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Issues Found

**None** - All validation checks passed ✅

### Resolution History

1. **FR-005 Clarification** (Resolved 2025-10-23):
   - **Original Issue**: Code review process not specified
   - **User Choice**: Option A - PR with 1 reviewer required
   - **Updated FR-005**: "System MUST prevent direct commits to core branch without appropriate review (pull requests require at least 1 reviewer approval before merging)"

### Items Passed

- ✅ All user stories are independently testable
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively identified (8 scenarios)
- ✅ Assumptions clearly documented
- ✅ Dependencies identified
- ✅ Out of scope items clearly stated
- ✅ Key entities defined without implementation details
- ✅ No technology-specific details (e.g., "GitHub Actions" appears only in assumptions/dependencies, not requirements)

## Notes

- One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains and requires user input
- Specification is otherwise ready for planning phase
- All content is appropriately non-technical and business-focused
