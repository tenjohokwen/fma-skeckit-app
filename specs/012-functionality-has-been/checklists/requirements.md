## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-21

### Content Quality
✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses entirely on documentation updates without mentioning implementation details like Vue, markdown processors, or file editing tools. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Scope) are completed with appropriate detail.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **Pass** - All 10 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous:
- FR-001 through FR-010 specify exactly what documentation changes must occur
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all documentation changes are clearly defined based on known feature removals)
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "Zero references to 'Files' menu", "100% of documented navigation paths work correctly")
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic and focus on user-observable documentation accuracy
- Edge cases identified for bookmarked docs, old printed copies, and user discovery of changes
- Scope clearly defines what is in scope (9 items) and what is out of scope (8 items)
- 6 assumptions documented (A-001 through A-006)
- 5 dependencies documented (D-001 through D-005)

### Feature Readiness
✅ **Pass** - The specification is ready for planning:
- Four prioritized user stories with clear acceptance scenarios:
  - US1 (P1): Remove Outdated File Management Documentation - 4 acceptance scenarios
  - US2 (P2): Remove Outdated Client Management Documentation - 3 acceptance scenarios
  - US3 (P1): Update Navigation Menu Documentation - 3 acceptance scenarios
  - US4 (P3): Add Dashboard Analytics Documentation - 3 acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation leakage (no mention of markdown editors, specific tools, or implementation methods)
- Feature can be independently tested by comparing documentation to actual application
- Migration notes provide clear guidance on what was removed, updated, and added

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification successfully defines a focused documentation update feature based on recent application changes (removal of FileManagementPage and ClientManagementPage in feature 011). All requirements are clear and testable, with no ambiguities requiring clarification. The feature can proceed directly to `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1 > P2 > P3) based on user impact
- Comprehensive mapping of what needs to be removed from documentation
- Well-defined success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Explicit dependencies on previous features (011-as-a-user, 008-dashboard-analytics)
- Clear scope boundaries prevent scope creep
- Edge cases address common documentation update concerns

### Recommendations
None - specification is complete and ready for implementation planning. The documentation updates are straightforward removals and updates based on known application changes.
