# Specification Quality Checklist: Dashboard Access Parity for All Users

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASS

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning.

### Details

**Content Quality**: ✅ All items pass
- Specification focuses on user needs and business value
- No technical implementation details (Vue, Google Apps Script, etc.) mentioned
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ All items pass
- All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are testable
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- 6 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 2 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- 4 edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope items documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ All items pass
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User Story 1 (P1) provides independently testable MVP
- User Story 2 (P2) adds value without blocking P1
- Success criteria validate feature without referencing implementation

## Notes

This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.
