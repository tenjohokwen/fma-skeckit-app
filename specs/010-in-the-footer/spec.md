# Feature Specification: Footer Branding and Copyright

**Feature Branch**: `010-in-the-footer`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "in the footer of all pages add Powered by Virtues Cafe as well as Copyright © along with the current year"

**Note**: All features must comply with the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, including Vue 3 Composition API requirements, component isolation testing standards, design system specifications, and performance requirements.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Footer Attribution (Priority: P1)

As a user visiting any page of the application, I need to see consistent branding and copyright information at the bottom of each page so that I understand who powers the application and when it was last updated.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement and provides essential legal protection through copyright notice and branding visibility. It's a single, cohesive piece of functionality that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to any page in the application and verifying that the footer displays "Powered by Virtues Cafe" and "Copyright © [current year]" in a consistent, visible manner.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they scroll to the bottom of the page, **Then** they see a footer displaying "Powered by Virtues Cafe" and "Copyright © 2025" (or current year)
2. **Given** a user is on the dashboard page, **When** they scroll to the bottom, **Then** they see the same footer with branding and copyright
3. **Given** a user is on any application page, **When** they view the footer, **Then** the copyright year automatically reflects the current year without requiring manual updates
4. **Given** a new calendar year begins, **When** a user views any page, **Then** the footer displays the updated year automatically

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the page content is very short and doesn't require scrolling? (Footer should still be visible at the bottom of the viewport or page)
- How does the footer appear on mobile devices with limited screen width? (Should remain readable and properly formatted)
- What happens if the user's system date is incorrect? (Footer should use server-side or build-time year, not client-side date)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display "Powered by Virtues Cafe" text in the footer of all pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST display "Copyright ©" followed by the current year in the footer of all pages
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically update the copyright year to match the current calendar year without manual intervention
- **FR-004**: Footer MUST appear consistently across all application pages (authenticated and unauthenticated)
- **FR-005**: Footer MUST remain visible and readable on all supported screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **FR-006**: Footer text MUST be properly formatted with appropriate spacing between "Powered by Virtues Cafe" and the copyright notice

### Key Entities

This feature does not introduce new data entities.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Footer displays correctly on 100% of application pages
- **SC-002**: Footer text is readable on all device sizes (viewport widths from 320px to 1920px)
- **SC-003**: Copyright year updates automatically without requiring code changes when the calendar year changes
- **SC-004**: Footer rendering does not negatively impact page load performance (no measurable delay)
- **SC-005**: Users can easily identify the application provider ("Virtues Cafe") from any page

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: The footer should use the current year based on the client's local time (JavaScript Date object) for dynamic updates
- **A-002**: The footer should be part of the main layout component that wraps all pages
- **A-003**: The footer styling should be subtle and non-intrusive, typically using muted colors and smaller font size
- **A-004**: "Virtues Cafe" refers to the organization/company name and should be displayed as provided without modification
- **A-005**: The footer should be positioned at the bottom of the page content, allowing natural scrolling behavior (not fixed/sticky to viewport)

## Dependencies

- **D-001**: Requires access to the main layout component(s) used across all application pages
- **D-002**: Requires understanding of the current page structure and layout system (appears to be Quasar-based from project context)

## Scope
