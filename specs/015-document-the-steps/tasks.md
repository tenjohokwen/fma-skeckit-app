# Tasks: Application Icon & Splash Screen Replacement Guide

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-document-the-steps/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md

**Constitution Compliance**: This is a documentation feature. Constitution principles related to code (Vue 3, JavaScript, testing) do not apply. Applicable requirements:
- Documentation MUST be clear and concise
- Documentation MUST be validated by actual developers following the steps
- Documentation MUST be accurate and complete

**Tests**: No automated tests for this feature. Validation is manual - developers must successfully follow the documentation to replace icons.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent delivery of documentation sections.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can be written in parallel (different sections, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task serves (US1, US2, US3)
- All paths are relative to repository root

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel if multiple writers available
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3) for single writer
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 but independently useful
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently useful

### Within Each User Story

- Documentation sections should be written in order (5.1 before 5.2 before 5.3)
- Examples should be written after their corresponding instruction sections
- Troubleshooting should be written based on actual validation experience
- Validation task must complete before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks can run in parallel
- **Phase 2**: All foundational sections (T004-T007) can be written in parallel - different sections
- **Phase 3-5**: If multiple writers, each can take a different user story after Phase 2 completes
- **Phase 6**: Troubleshooting issues (T023-T024) can be written in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 (Foundational Sections)

```bash
# Launch all foundational sections together:
Task: "Write Section 1 (Overview) in docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md"
Task: "Write Section 2 (Prerequisites) in docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md"
Task: "Write Section 3 (Icon Requirements) in docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md"
Task: "Write Section 4 (File Locations) in docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - provides context for all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Have developer test icon replacement on main branch
5. If validated, merge to main - developers can now replace icons!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Basic documentation structure ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Merge (MVP! Main branch icon replacement works)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Merge (Icon quality verification added)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí Merge (Client workflow complete)
5. Add Polish ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí Merge (Complete, polished documentation)

Each increment adds value without breaking previous increments.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple technical writers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (or assigns sections)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Writer A: User Story 1 (main branch workflow)
   - Writer B: User Story 2 (quality verification)
   - Writer C: User Story 3 (client workflow)
3. Stories complete independently, then integrate for final review

## Success Criteria Verification

After completing all tasks, verify against Success Criteria from spec.md:

- [ ] **SC-001**: Time developer following documentation ‚Üí Must be < 10 minutes
- [ ] **SC-002**: Test with multiple developers ‚Üí 100% should see correct custom icon when following docs
- [ ] **SC-003**: Verify generated .icns/.ico files contain all size variants (16x16 through 1024x1024)
- [ ] **SC-004**: Confirm visual inspection sufficient (no specialized tools needed)
- [ ] **SC-005**: Test merge workflow ‚Üí Should result in zero conflicts when following documented process
- [ ] **SC-006**: Survey developers ‚Üí 95% should correctly identify both file locations on first attempt

---

## File Summary

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `docs/ICON-REPLACEMENT.md` (new file - main deliverable)
- `README.md` (modified - add documentation link)
- `specs/015-document-the-steps/checklists/documentation-validation.md` (new file - validation checklist)

**Total Tasks**: 30
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundational: 4 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 5 tasks (4 implementation + 1 validation)
- User Story 2 (P2): 4 tasks (3 implementation + 1 validation)
- User Story 3 (P3): 6 tasks (5 implementation + 1 validation)
- Polish: 8 tasks (4 documentation + 4 integration/validation)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 15 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with others

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different sections/files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently deliverable
- Manual validation after each story ensures documentation actually works
- Commit frequently (after each section or logical group)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
- This is documentation - no automated tests, validation is manual and iterative
