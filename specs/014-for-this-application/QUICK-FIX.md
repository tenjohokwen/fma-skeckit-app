# Quick Fix for GitHub Actions Error

## The Problem
GitHub Actions workflow fails with:
```
npm error Invalid Version:
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause
The workflow tries to checkout branch `client/bechem` which **doesn't exist yet**.

## The Solution (2 minutes)

Create the client branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b client/bechem
git push -u origin client/bechem
```

Then re-run the GitHub Actions workflow. It will succeed! ✅

## Why This Happens

The workflow has this code:
```yaml
- name: Checkout client branch
  with:
    ref: client/${{ inputs.client }}
```

If `client/bechem` doesn't exist, the checkout fails and causes downstream errors.

## Proper Setup Order

1. ✅ Merge feature 014 to main (or test from feature branch)
2. ✅ **Create client branch** (the missing step!)
3. ✅ Run GitHub Actions workflow

## Detailed Fix
