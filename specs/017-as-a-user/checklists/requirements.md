# Specification Quality Checklist: Case-Insensitive Status Handling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASS - All validation items passed

**Details**:
- Specification is complete with 2 prioritized user stories (P1, P2)
- 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are clear and testable
- 5 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-005) are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases identified for whitespace handling, null values, special characters, internationalization, and future data
- Scope is clearly bounded with Assumptions and Out of Scope sections
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- No implementation details (no mention of specific languages, frameworks, or databases)
- All requirements focus on user-facing behavior and business outcomes

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Title case normalization (e.g., "Open", "In Progress") is the assumed standard display format
- Backend normalization is recommended but not mandated - implementation can decide between backend or frontend normalization
