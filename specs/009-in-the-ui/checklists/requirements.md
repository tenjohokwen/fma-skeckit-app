# Specification Quality Checklist: Client Status Update Email Notifications

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without mentioning Vue components, Google Apps Script specifics, or API endpoints. References to "Script Properties" are configuration requirements, not implementation details.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories emphasize business outcomes (client communication automation, data quality enforcement, professional email delivery).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Readable by business stakeholders without technical jargon.

✅ **All sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions all completed.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are fully specified with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR has observable outcomes (e.g., FR-002 "display a confirmation dialog", FR-007 "send notification email in the language selected").

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 1 minute"
- SC-002: "95% success rate within 30 seconds"
- SC-003: "within 500ms"
- SC-004: "Zero instances"

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes without implementation details:
- "Case managers can complete..." (not "Vue component renders...")
- "Email delivered..." (not "GmailApp API succeeds...")

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story includes 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 9 edge cases documented with expected behaviors.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**:
- Limited to status field changes only
- Two languages (English/French) only
- Single email per update
- No retry logic for failed emails

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: 12 assumptions documented including client email availability, email service access, and existing i18n infrastructure.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Acceptance criteria present**: All 18 functional requirements are testable via acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **User scenarios comprehensive**: 4 prioritized user stories cover:
- P1: Core email notification flow (MVP)
- P2: Notes validation enforcement
- P2: Email template quality
- P3: Bilingual UI

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 9 success criteria covering performance, reliability, completeness, and UX.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction throughout.

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

All quality gates passed on first validation. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Testable and measurable
- Technology-agnostic and stakeholder-friendly
- Ready for implementation planning

No clarifications needed from the user.
