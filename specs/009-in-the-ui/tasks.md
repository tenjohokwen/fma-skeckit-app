# Tasks: Client Status Update Email Notifications

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/009-in-the-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Constitution Compliance**: All tasks must adhere to the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This includes:
- Using Vue 3 `<script setup>` and Composition API exclusively
- Plain JavaScript only (no TypeScript)
- Functional component splitting with single responsibility
- Component size limits (‚â§250 lines)
- Test file per component
- Design system adherence (colors, typography, layout)
- Performance requirements (lazy loading, efficient reactivity, cleanup)
- Accessibility and responsive design requirements

**Tests**: Component tests are included per constitution requirements (one test file per component).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Frontend**: `src/` (Vue 3 + Quasar components)
- **Backend**: `gas/` (Google Apps Script)
- **Tests**: `tests/` (Vitest + Vue Test Utils)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and ensure development environment is ready

- [x] T001 Verify Vue 3, Quasar 2, and Vite development environment is configured
- [x] T002 Verify Google Apps Script project connection and clasp deployment setup
- [x] T003 [P] Verify i18n framework is configured for English and French translations

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Development environment ready for implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Configure SIGNATURE script property in Google Apps Script PropertiesService (optional, for email signature)
- [x] T005 Verify test client record has email address configured for testing
- [x] T006 [P] Create test fixtures for email notification testing (mock case data, mock client data)

**Checkpoint**: ‚úÖ Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Core Status Update with Email Dialog (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: When a case manager updates a case status, the system prompts them to optionally notify the client via email in their preferred language.

**Independent Test**: Load a case, change status, and verify the email prompt appears with language selection. Accept email notification and verify email is sent with correct language.

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T007 [P] [US1] Create test file `tests/unit/components/metadata/EmailNotificationDialog.test.js`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - Core MVP functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Adds validation on top of US1
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Enhances email templates from US1
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion - Adds i18n to dialog from US1
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Adds notes validation to existing dialog
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Enhances email templates created in US1
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Adds translations to dialog created in US1

**Note**: US2, US3, and US4 all depend on US1, but are independent of each other. Once US1 is complete, US2, US3, and US4 can be implemented in parallel if team capacity allows.

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (P1)**:
1. Tests (T007-T013) can run in parallel
2. Frontend dialog component (T014-T019) sequential within, but parallel to backend work
3. Frontend CaseEditor integration (T020-T025) depends on dialog component
4. Frontend API extension (T026-T027) parallel to dialog work
5. Backend template utility (T028-T031) can start early, parallel to frontend
6. Backend email service (T032-T036) depends on template utility
7. Backend handler extension (T037-T042) depends on email service
8. Frontend notifications (T043-T045) final integration step

**User Story 2 (P2)**:
1. Tests (T046-T048) before implementation
2. All implementation tasks (T049-T055) modify EmailNotificationDialog, must be sequential

**User Story 3 (P2)**:
1. Tests (T056-T059) can run in parallel
2. Implementation tasks (T060-T065) sequential, all modify emailTemplates.gs

**User Story 4 (P3)**:
1. Tests (T066-T068) can run in parallel
2. English translations (T069-T082) can run in parallel as one batch
3. French translations (T083-T096) can run in parallel as one batch
4. UI integration (T097-T104) sequential, modifies EmailNotificationDialog

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**:
- T001, T002, T003 can all run in parallel

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T004, T005, T006 can all run in parallel

**Within User Story 1**:
- Tests (T007-T013) all parallel
- T014-T019 (dialog) parallel to T028-T031 (backend templates)
- T026-T027 (API) parallel to template work

**Within User Story 2**:
- Tests (T046-T048) all parallel

**Within User Story 3**:
- Tests (T056-T059) all parallel

**Within User Story 4**:
- Tests (T066-T068) all parallel
- English translations (T069-T082) all parallel
- French translations (T083-T096) all parallel

**Within Polish (Phase 7)**:
- Most tasks (T105-T130) can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "T007 Create test file EmailNotificationDialog.test.js"
Task: "T008 Write test: Dialog renders with correct i18n strings"
Task: "T009 Write test: Language selection updates reactive state"
Task: "T010 Write test: Confirm event emitted with sendEmail=true"
Task: "T011 Write test: Confirm event emitted with sendEmail=false"
Task: "T012 Write test: Cancel event emitted"
Task: "T013 Write test: No status change skips dialog"

# Launch frontend and backend work in parallel:
Frontend: "T014 Create EmailNotificationDialog.vue"
Backend: "T028 Create emailTemplates.gs"

# After dialog complete, integrate with CaseEditor:
Task: "T020 Import EmailNotificationDialog in CaseEditor"
Task: "T021 Add status change detection logic"
# ... etc
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T007-T045)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Change status ‚Üí Dialog appears
   - Select language ‚Üí Email sends in correct language
   - Decline email ‚Üí Case updates without email
   - Cancel dialog ‚Üí No changes saved
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**Estimated Time for MVP**: 8-10 hours

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP (US1)**: Core email notification functionality ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
2. **+US2**: Add notes validation ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (prevents emails without context)
3. **+US3**: Enhance email templates ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (professional appearance)
4. **+US4**: Add French UI translations ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (bilingual support complete)
5. **Polish**: Final quality checks ‚Üí Production-ready

**Total Estimated Time**: 12-16 hours for complete feature

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Setup + Foundational**: Team completes together (1-2 hours)
2. **User Story 1**: Full team focuses on MVP (6-8 hours)
3. **Once US1 complete, parallelize**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (notes validation)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (email templates)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (i18n)
4. **Polish**: Team reviews together (2-3 hours)

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 133
- **Setup**: 3 tasks
- **Foundational**: 3 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 39 tasks (7 tests + 32 implementation)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: 10 tasks (4 tests + 6 implementation)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: 39 tasks (3 tests + 36 implementation)
- **Polish**: 29 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 60+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**MVP Scope** (User Story 1 only): 45 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1)

**Suggested First Milestone**: Complete User Story 1 for immediate value delivery

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution compliance is mandatory for all implementation tasks
- Email sending is async - expect 1-3 second latency
- Test with real email addresses to verify delivery
- SIGNATURE property is optional - feature works without it
