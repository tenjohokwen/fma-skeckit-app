- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-21

### Content Quality
✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses entirely on what the footer should display and where, without mentioning any implementation technologies. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with appropriate detail.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **Pass** - All 6 functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous:
- FR-001 through FR-006 specify exactly what text must be displayed and where
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "100% of application pages", "viewport widths from 320px to 1920px")
- All success criteria avoid implementation details and focus on user-observable outcomes
- Edge cases identified for short pages, mobile devices, and date handling
- Scope clearly defines what is included and excluded
- Assumptions and dependencies are documented

### Feature Readiness
✅ **Pass** - The specification is ready for planning:
- Single user story with clear acceptance scenarios (login page, dashboard, any page, year rollover)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation leakage (no mention of Vue, components, CSS, etc.)
- Feature can be independently tested and deployed

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification successfully defines a simple, focused feature for adding footer branding and copyright information. All requirements are clear and testable, with no ambiguities requiring clarification. The feature can proceed directly to `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths
- Clear, singular focus on footer attribution
- Comprehensive edge case identification
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Appropriate level of detail for a simple UI addition

### Recommendations
None - specification is complete and ready for implementation planning.
