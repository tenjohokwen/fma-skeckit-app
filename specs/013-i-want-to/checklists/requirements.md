# Specification Quality Checklist: Desktop Application Packaging

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-22

### Content Quality
✅ **Pass** - The specification is focused on business value and user needs. While it mentions technology names like "Electron or Tauri", these are in the Assumptions section where they belong, not in requirements or user stories. The requirements are technology-agnostic (e.g., "System MUST package...into native desktop installers" rather than "System MUST use Electron to...").

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **Pass** - All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved. The code signing question has been answered: code signing will not be available initially, packages will be unsigned, and users will see security warnings (especially on macOS). This is documented in the Edge Cases section and aligns with Assumption A-009.

All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "under 10 minutes per platform", "under 150MB", "under 3 seconds") and technology-agnostic (no mention of specific implementations).

### Feature Readiness
✅ **Pass** - The spec appropriately separates business requirements from implementation assumptions:
- Requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) are technology-agnostic and focus on capabilities
- Assumption A-007 mentions "Electron or similar framework (Tauri, NW.js)" - appropriate for assumptions
- Dependency D-002 provides implementation guidance - acceptable since it's not in requirements
- Edge cases now include concrete answer about code signing approach

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`.

### Strengths
- Five well-prioritized user stories (two P1, one P2, two P3) covering all aspects of desktop packaging
- Comprehensive functional requirements (15 items) covering packaging, installation, updates, and platform integration
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics (10 success criteria with concrete numbers)
- Clear scope boundaries distinguishing what is and isn't included
- Realistic assumptions about platform support and technical approach
- All edge cases addressed with concrete answers
- Code signing approach clearly documented (unsigned initially, can add later)

### Recommendations
- Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan
- The spec is ready for technical planning without additional clarification needed
