# Feature Specification: Desktop Application Packaging

**Feature Branch**: `013-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to be able to package the application for use as a desktop application. I should be able to create packaging for all major platforms from one machine. I suggest 'packager'"

**Note**: All features must comply with the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, including Vue 3 Composition API requirements, component isolation testing standards, design system specifications, and performance requirements.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Package for Windows (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to create a Windows desktop application package from my development machine so that users can install and run the FMA Skeckit App natively on Windows without needing a web browser.

**Why this priority**: Windows is the dominant desktop operating system in enterprise environments where legal/case management applications are commonly used. This is the highest-priority platform for desktop deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the packaging command, installing the resulting .exe installer on a Windows machine, launching the application, and verifying all functionality works identically to the web version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is on any OS with the packager installed, **When** they run the Windows packaging command, **Then** a Windows installer (.exe or .msi) is created in the build output directory
2. **Given** a Windows user has downloaded the installer, **When** they run the installer, **Then** the application is installed to their system with a desktop shortcut and Start menu entry
3. **Given** the application is installed on Windows, **When** the user launches it, **Then** it opens in a native window with all web functionality working (authentication, search, case management, file operations)
4. **Given** the Windows app is running, **When** the user closes the window, **Then** the application terminates cleanly without leaving background processes

### User Story 2 - Package for macOS (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need to create a macOS desktop application package from my development machine so that Mac users can install and run the FMA Skeckit App natively without needing a web browser.

**Why this priority**: macOS has significant market share in professional/creative industries and is growing in enterprise adoption. Second-priority after Windows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the packaging command, installing the resulting .dmg or .pkg on a macOS machine, launching the application from Applications folder, and verifying all functionality works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is on any OS with the packager installed, **When** they run the macOS packaging command, **Then** a macOS installer (.dmg or .pkg) is created in the build output directory
2. **Given** a macOS user has downloaded the installer, **When** they mount the .dmg and drag the app to Applications, **Then** the application is installed and appears in Launchpad and Applications folder
3. **Given** the application is installed on macOS, **When** the user launches it, **Then** it opens in a native window with native macOS menu bar and all web functionality working
4. **Given** the macOS app supports system integration, **When** applicable, **Then** it respects macOS-specific features (e.g., fullscreen mode, notification center integration)

### User Story 3 - Package for Linux (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need to create Linux desktop application packages from my development machine so that Linux users can install and run the FMA Skeckit App natively in their preferred distribution.

**Why this priority**: Linux desktop usage is lower in the target market, making it lower priority than Windows and macOS, but still valuable for technical users and certain organizations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the packaging command, installing the resulting .AppImage, .deb, or .rpm on a Linux distribution, launching the application, and verifying functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is on any OS with the packager installed, **When** they run the Linux packaging command, **Then** Linux packages (.AppImage, .deb, and/or .rpm) are created in the build output directory
2. **Given** a Linux user has downloaded the package, **When** they install it using their package manager or run the AppImage, **Then** the application is available in their application menu or can be launched directly
3. **Given** the application is installed on Linux, **When** the user launches it, **Then** it opens in a native window with all web functionality working
4. **Given** the Linux app is packaged as AppImage, **When** the user runs it, **Then** it works without installation on any modern Linux distribution

### User Story 4 - Cross-Platform Build from Single Machine (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to build packages for all three major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) from a single development machine so that I don't need separate build environments for each target platform.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for development efficiency and CI/CD automation. Without cross-platform building, the packaging process becomes significantly more complex and time-consuming.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single packaging command that targets all platforms from one machine (e.g., macOS or Linux), verifying all platform packages are created successfully, and testing each on its target OS.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer is on their development machine, **When** they run the packaging command with "all platforms" option, **Then** Windows, macOS, and Linux packages are all created in the output directory
2. **Given** the developer wants to build for a specific platform only, **When** they run the packaging command with a platform flag (e.g., --platform=windows), **Then** only that platform's package is created
3. **Given** the packaging process encounters platform-specific requirements (e.g., code signing), **When** credentials or certificates are not provided, **Then** the build completes but warns about missing signatures
4. **Given** the packaging completes, **When** the developer reviews the output, **Then** they see clear success/failure status for each platform with file sizes and output paths

---

### User Story 5 - Application Auto-Update (Priority: P3)

As a desktop application user, I want to be notified when a new version is available and be able to update the application easily so that I always have the latest features and security patches.

**Why this priority**: Auto-update is valuable for maintainability but not critical for initial desktop release. Can be added after core packaging is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying a new version to an update server, launching an older version of the desktop app, verifying the update notification appears, and confirming the update installs successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the desktop application is running, **When** it checks for updates (on launch or periodically), **Then** it queries the update server for the latest version number
2. **Given** a new version is available, **When** the user is notified, **Then** they see a dialog with release notes and options to "Update Now" or "Remind Me Later"
3. **Given** the user chooses to update, **When** the update downloads, **Then** they see download progress and the update installs automatically after download completes
4. **Given** the update installs, **When** it completes, **Then** the application restarts with the new version

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the build process fails for one platform but succeeds for others? (System should continue building remaining platforms and report which ones failed)
- How does the application handle offline mode in desktop environment? (Should work like a PWA with offline capabilities)
- What happens when the user has insufficient disk space for installation? (Installer should detect and warn before installation begins)
- How does the application handle updates when the user doesn't have admin privileges? (Should support per-user installations that don't require elevation)
- What happens if the application tries to auto-update while the user is actively working? (Should defer update until application is idle or explicitly requested)
- How does code signing work for platforms that require it (macOS, Windows)? (Code signing will not be available initially. Build process will create unsigned packages. Users will see security warnings when installing, especially on macOS Gatekeeper. Code signing can be added later as a production hardening step.)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST package the Vue 3/Quasar web application into native desktop installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux

- **SC-009**: 95% of users can successfully install and launch the desktop application on first attempt without technical support
- **SC-010**: Desktop application respects platform conventions for menus, keyboard shortcuts, and window behavior

## Assumptions

- **A-001**: The current Vue 3/Quasar web application is built with Vite and produces a static build output in `/dist` directory
- **A-002**: The target platforms are Windows 10/11, macOS 11+, and modern Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 35+)
- **A-003**: The development machine has sufficient resources (16GB+ RAM, 50GB+ free disk space) to build for multiple platforms
- **A-004**: The application's backend APIs are accessible over HTTPS and don't require modification for desktop usage
- **A-005**: Users installing the desktop application have standard user permissions (admin not required for per-user install)
- **A-006**: Desktop application will connect to the same backend services as the web version (no separate desktop API needed)
- **A-007**: Electron or similar framework (Tauri, NW.js) will be used as the desktop wrapper technology
- **A-008**: Auto-update feature will require a publicly accessible update server hosting version manifests and package files
- **A-009**: Code signing is desirable but not required for initial release (can be added later for production)
- **A-010**: The desktop application will maintain the same authentication flow as the web version (no separate desktop credentials)

## Dependencies

- **D-001**: Requires the web application build process to be working correctly (`npm run build` produces valid output)
- **D-002**: Requires selection of a desktop framework (Electron recommended for maximum compatibility, Tauri for smaller size)
- **D-003**: Requires npm/yarn for dependency management and build scripts
- **D-004**: Requires platform-specific build tools if not using pure JavaScript packager (e.g., WiX for Windows MSI, dpkg for Debian packages)
- **D-005**: May require code signing certificates for Windows and macOS if deploying signed packages
- **D-006**: Requires hosting infrastructure for auto-update feature (update server with version manifests)
- **D-007**: Requires application icons in multiple sizes and formats for each platform

## Scope

### In Scope

- Setting up desktop packaging infrastructure using Electron or Tauri
- Creating build scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux packages
- Configuring cross-platform build capability from a single machine
- Creating platform-specific installers (.exe, .dmg, .AppImage, etc.)
- Bundling the existing Vue/Quasar web application into desktop packages
- Implementing basic application lifecycle management (launch, quit, window state)
- Adding application icons and metadata for all platforms
- Creating documentation for the build process
- Setting up automated build scripts suitable for CI/CD
- Implementing optional auto-update mechanism
- Configuring platform-specific integrations (notifications, deep linking)

### Out of Scope

- Modifying the core web application functionality (desktop version must match web exactly)
- Creating platform-specific features that don't exist in the web version
- Implementing offline-first architecture changes (web app's existing offline capabilities will work as-is)
- Distributing through app stores (Microsoft Store, Mac App Store, Snap Store) - can be added later
- Implementing DRM or license management for the desktop application
- Creating separate backend APIs for desktop clients
- Implementing desktop-specific UI redesigns
- Supporting legacy operating systems (Windows 7/8, macOS 10.x, very old Linux distributions)
- Performance optimization beyond what the web version already provides
- Creating custom update server infrastructure (will use existing solutions like electron-updater)

## Migration Notes

- **New Infrastructure**: This feature introduces desktop application packaging capability to a currently web-only application
- **No Breaking Changes**: The web version remains unchanged and fully functional
- **Build Process Addition**: Adds new build scripts and configuration files for desktop packaging
- **Optional Deployment**: Desktop packages are an additional deployment option, not a replacement for web deployment
- **User Transition**: Users can choose to use desktop or web version; both access the same backend and data
- **Development Workflow**: Developers will need to install desktop framework dependencies (Electron/Tauri) and may need platform-specific build tools
