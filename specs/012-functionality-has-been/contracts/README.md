# API Contracts: Update User Guide Documentation

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](../plan.md)
**Date**: 2025-10-21

## Overview

This feature does NOT involve any API contracts, endpoints, or data exchange formats. It is a pure documentation update with zero impact on application APIs or backend systems.

## Contract Changes

**No API changes** - This feature:
- Does NOT add new endpoints
- Does NOT modify existing endpoints
- Does NOT change request/response formats
- Does NOT affect authentication or authorization flows
- Does NOT interact with backend systems
- Does NOT consume or produce data via APIs

## Existing APIs (Unchanged)

All existing application APIs remain completely unchanged:

- **Authentication APIs**: Login, signup, email verification, token refresh
- **Client APIs**: Search, read, create, update operations
- **Case APIs**: CRUD operations for cases
- **File APIs**: Upload, download, delete, list operations
- **Dashboard Analytics APIs**: Chart data aggregation and retrieval
- **Google Apps Script Backend**: All endpoints unchanged

## Documentation-Only Change

This feature modifies a single markdown file (`/docs/user-guide.md`) to reflect recent application changes. The documentation update involves:

- **Input**: Plain text markdown file (current state)
- **Processing**: Manual content editing (removal, addition, reorganization)
- **Output**: Plain text markdown file (updated state)

No network requests, API calls, or data exchange occur as part of this feature.

## File System Operations

The only "interface" for this feature is the file system:

**Operation**: Read/Write to local file
- **Path**: `/docs/user-guide.md`
- **Format**: Plain text (Markdown)
- **Protocol**: Local filesystem I/O
- **Authorization**: File system permissions (not application auth)

This is not an API contract in the traditional sense - it's simply file editing.

## Summary

No API contracts, OpenAPI specifications, GraphQL schemas, REST endpoints, or data exchange formats are needed for this feature. It is exclusively a documentation content update with no programmatic interfaces.
