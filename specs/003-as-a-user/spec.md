# Feature Specification: Admin Client Information Editing

**Feature Branch**: `003-as-a-user`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "As a user with admin rights, I want to be able to edit the personal information of the client"

**Note**: All features must comply with the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, including Vue 3 Composition API requirements, component isolation testing standards, design system specifications, and performance requirements.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Admin Edits Client Basic Information (Priority: P1)

An administrator views a client's details page and needs to update outdated or incorrect personal information such as name, telephone number, or email address. The admin clicks an "Edit" button, modifies the information in an inline form, and saves the changes. The system validates the input and updates the client record.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that directly addresses data maintenance needs. Without this, admins cannot correct client information errors, which impacts communication and service delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to a client details page, clicking edit, changing any personal information field, and verifying the changes persist after save. Delivers immediate value by allowing data corrections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin is viewing a client's details page, **When** they click the "Edit" button, **Then** the personal information fields become editable in place
2. **Given** editable client fields are displayed, **When** the admin updates the telephone number and clicks "Save", **Then** the new telephone number is saved and displayed
3. **Given** editable client fields are displayed, **When** the admin updates the email address to an invalid format and clicks "Save", **Then** a validation error is shown and changes are not saved
4. **Given** editable client fields are displayed, **When** the admin clicks "Cancel", **Then** all changes are discarded and fields return to read-only mode with original values

---

### User Story 2 - Validation and Error Handling (Priority: P2)

When an administrator attempts to save client information, the system validates all fields according to business rules (e.g., national ID uniqueness, email format, required fields). If validation fails, clear error messages are displayed next to the relevant fields, preventing data corruption.

**Why this priority**: Essential for data integrity but can be tested after basic edit functionality works. Prevents invalid data from entering the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to save invalid data (duplicate national ID, invalid email, empty required fields) and verifying appropriate error messages appear without saving.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin is editing client information, **When** they attempt to save with a national ID that already exists for another client, **Then** an error message displays "This National ID is already registered to another client"
2. **Given** an admin is editing client information, **When** they clear a required field (first name or last name) and attempt to save, **Then** an error message displays "This field is required" and the save is prevented
3. **Given** an admin is editing client information, **When** they enter an improperly formatted email address, **Then** a real-time validation error appears indicating the email format is invalid

---

### User Story 3 - Audit Trail and Change Tracking (Priority: P3)

The system records who made changes to client information and when. Admins can view a change history showing previous values, new values, the admin who made the change, and the timestamp.

**Why this priority**: Important for accountability and compliance but not required for basic editing functionality. Can be added after core edit features are stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making changes to client information, then viewing an audit log or history section that shows the change details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin has edited and saved client information, **When** they view the client details page, **Then** a "Last Updated" timestamp is displayed showing when and by whom the last change was made
2. **Given** an admin views the client details page, **When** they click "View Change History", **Then** a list of all previous changes is displayed with old value, new value, admin name, and timestamp

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an admin tries to edit client information while another admin is simultaneously editing the same client?
- How does the system handle attempting to save changes when the network connection is lost?
- What occurs if an admin navigates away from the page with unsaved changes?
- How does the system respond if a client's personal information contains special characters or non-Latin scripts?
- What happens if an admin tries to change a national ID to one that was previously used but is now deleted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict client information editing to users with admin role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST display an "Edit" button on the client details page that is visible only to administrators
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow admins to edit the following client fields: first name, last name, national ID, telephone, and email
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that national ID is unique across all clients before saving
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate email address format before saving
- **FR-006**: System MUST require first name, last name, and national ID as mandatory fields
- **FR-007**: System MUST display validation errors next to the relevant field without leaving the edit mode
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow admins to cancel editing and revert all unsaved changes
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist saved changes to the clients sheet in Google Sheets
- **FR-010**: System MUST update the "updatedAt" timestamp when client information is modified
- **FR-011**: System MUST refresh the client details view to show updated information after successful save
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent loss of unsaved changes by warning users before navigation

### Key Entities

- **Client**: Represents a person receiving services, with attributes including:
  - Unique identifier (clientId)
  - Personal information (first name, last name, national ID, telephone, email)
  - Metadata (folder ID for associated files, creation timestamp, last update timestamp)
  - Relationship to multiple case folders

- **Admin User**: A user with administrative privileges who can modify client information, with attributes including:
  - User identifier
  - Role designation (ROLE_ADMIN)
  - Audit trail association (changes made by this admin)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Admins can edit and save client information in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: 95% of save attempts succeed on first try when valid data is provided
- **SC-003**: Zero instances of duplicate national IDs after validation is implemented
- **SC-004**: Validation errors are displayed within 1 second of user input
- **SC-005**: All client information changes are successfully persisted to the database
- **SC-006**: Admins successfully complete the edit workflow without errors in 90% of attempts

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

1. **Admin Authentication**: Admins are already authenticated and their role is verified before reaching the client details page
2. **Edit Permissions**: Only users with ROLE_ADMIN can edit client information; regular users can only view
3. **Data Format**: National ID format follows the existing validation rules already in the system
4. **Concurrent Editing**: For the initial implementation, last-save-wins approach is acceptable (optimistic locking can be added later as P3)
5. **Network Handling**: Standard HTTP request/response pattern with error handling is sufficient for the initial implementation
6. **Change History Storage**: Audit trail will use the existing "updatedAt" timestamp field; detailed change logs are P3 priority

## Dependencies

- **Existing Client Details Page**: This feature extends the current client details view
- **Admin Role Check**: Relies on existing authentication and authorization system
- **Google Sheets Backend**: Uses existing SheetsService for data persistence
- **Client Store**: Leverages existing Pinia client store for state management

## Out of Scope

- Editing case information (only client personal information)
- Bulk editing of multiple clients at once
- Reverting to previous versions of client information (undo functionality)
- Real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Email notifications when client information is changed
- Custom validation rules configurable by admins
