# Specification Quality Checklist: Application Icon & Splash Screen Replacement Guide

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All checklist items validated

### Detailed Validation

#### Content Quality
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT (documentation requirements) not HOW (tool implementation)
- ✅ Written for developers as users, focused on their needs (icon replacement task)
- ✅ No framework/language-specific details (mentions PNG, git, build commands but not implementation)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

#### Requirement Completeness
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are explicit
- ✅ Each FR is testable (e.g., "Documentation MUST specify..." can be verified by reading the docs)
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are specific
- ✅ Edge cases identified (invalid formats, missing files, size mismatches)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed

#### Feature Readiness
- ✅ All 10 functional requirements have corresponding acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover all primary flows (replace icon, verify quality, client branding)
- ✅ Six success criteria provide measurable outcomes
- ✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic (no mentions of specific doc tools, formats, or implementations)

## Notes

This is a documentation feature specification, which is slightly meta (documenting how to document/replace icons). The specification successfully:

1. Defines what the documentation must contain (format specs, file locations, commands)
2. Establishes measurable success (time to complete, error rates, visual verification)
3. Avoids prescribing documentation format or tools
4. Clearly separates what should be documented (icon replacement) from how to document it

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` can proceed - no clarifications needed.
