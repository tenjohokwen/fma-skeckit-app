- [x] **Out of scope clearly stated** - Role management and fine-grained permissions excluded

### Technical Feasibility
- [x] **Dependencies identified** - None blocking, security critical priority
- [x] **Risks documented with mitigations** - 4 risks identified with mitigation strategies
- [x] **Current state analyzed** - Detailed analysis of existing admin checks
- [x] **Implementation pattern provided** - useRoleAccess composable pattern defined
- [x] **Technical constraints noted** - Backend must enforce authorization

### Security Considerations
- [x] **Authorization requirements clear** - All endpoints categorized by required role
- [x] **Security risks identified** - API bypass, privilege escalation covered
- [x] **Backend enforcement specified** - All checks must be server-side
- [x] **Testing strategy includes security tests** - Penetration testing mentioned

### User Experience

## Specification Completeness Score

**Total Items**: 24
**Passed**: 24
**Failed**: 0

**Score**: 100% ✅

## Critical Items

### Must Address Before Implementation:
1. ✅ All user stories have clear acceptance criteria
2. ✅ Security implications fully documented
3. ✅ Backend authorization pattern established
4. ✅ Testing strategy covers security vulnerabilities

### Nice to Have Before Implementation:
1. ⚠️ Answer open questions about file downloads (documented for decision)
2. ⚠️ Consider future "Viewer" role (documented as out of scope)
3. ⚠️ Audit logging requirements (documented as open question)

## Reviewer Notes

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive analysis of current state
- Clear security focus with backend-first approach
- Practical implementation patterns provided
- Thorough testing strategy

**Suggestions**:
- Consider answering open questions before implementation starts
- May want to document role hierarchy if more roles added in future
- Consider adding "Request Access" feature for non-admins (future enhancement)

## Approval Status

- [x] Specification meets quality standards
- [x] Ready for planning phase
- [x] Security requirements clearly defined
- [x] Implementation approach is feasible

**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for `/speckit.plan`
