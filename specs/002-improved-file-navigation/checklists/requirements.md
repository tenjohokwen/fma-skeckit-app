# Specification Quality Checklist: Improved File Navigation UX

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on user needs and system behavior without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches. All content is written from a business/user perspective.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All 47 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements use clear "MUST" language with specific conditions.

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - All 15 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time in seconds, percentages, completion rates). All are technology-agnostic and focus on user outcomes rather than system internals.

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **PASS** - 10 edge cases identified covering file conflicts, network issues, concurrent access, special characters, navigation edge cases, and error handling.

### User Scenarios Review
✅ **PASS** - 11 prioritized user stories (P1-P11) with clear acceptance scenarios. Each story is independently testable and delivers standalone value.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` - all validation criteria met
- All user stories are properly prioritized with clear justification
- Functional requirements comprehensively cover all 11 user stories
- Success criteria provide both quantitative (time/performance) and qualitative (satisfaction) measures
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are specific and actionable
